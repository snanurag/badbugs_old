Awesome game. It is in its early stage but, it has nice effects. Bugs crawling and knife slashing effects are superb. Graphics are basic. They need to be improved. Although, this concept seems new. On one touch you can target whole screen and kill the targets. That is something. There are only one type of bugs as of target right now. Scoring is also pretty basic. A lot of variety in bugs could be added with their special powers. This could be developed in arcade mode and with introduction of different kinds of bugs, different versions of stages could be produced. Bad bugs is lacking special effects as well. For example, Knife can generate a long trail. Killing of bugs could be very much with special effects. Even Knife seems to be of basic type as of now. There could be whole series of knives or different kind of ammunition could also be there.

As a concept it is a nice game. But there is a whole lot of scope for this as of now. Since, insects world is a large world. A lot could be added in this. And, a lot of powers of the current gaming industry could be added to it as well.
